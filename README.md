# Decision Tree Classification – Binary Classes (PGA 62)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Decision Tree Classification** pipeline for a **binary classification problem**.  
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, visualization, and performance evaluation.

The goal of this project is to clearly explain how a Decision Tree works and how it can be implemented in a real-world classification task.

## ⚙️ Model Building Steps
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values (if any)
3. Feature selection
4. Train-test split
5. Model training using Decision Tree
6. Hyperparameter tuning (if applicable)
7. Model evaluation
